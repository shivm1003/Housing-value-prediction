Gradient boosting is currently one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting that has taken data science by storm, with models using XGBoost regularly winning many online data science competitions and used at scale across different industries.l learn how to use this powerful library alongside pandas and scikit-learn to build and tune supervised learning models. I worked with real-world datasets to solve classification as well as regression problems.
